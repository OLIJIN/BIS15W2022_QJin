## Desert Ecology
For this assignment, we are going to use a modified data set on [desert ecology](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/). The data are from: S. K. Morgan Ernest, Thomas J. Valone, and James H. Brown. 2009. Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. Ecology 90:1708.

```r
deserts <- read_csv(here("lab10", "data", "surveys_complete.csv"))
```

```
## Rows: 34786 Columns: 13
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (6): species_id, sex, genus, species, taxa, plot_type
## dbl (7): record_id, month, day, year, plot_id, hindfoot_length, weight
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

1. Use the function(s) of your choice to get an idea of its structure, including how NA's are treated. Are the data tidy?  

```r
names(deserts)

2. How many genera and species are represented in the data? What are the total number of observations? Which species is most/ least frequently sampled in the study?
There are 26 genera and 40 species represented in the data. Clarki, scutalatus, tereticaudus, tigris, uniparens, viridis are the least frequently sampled in the study. 

```r
deserts %>% 
  count(genus, sort=T)
```

```
## # A tibble: 26 × 2
##    genus                n
##    <chr>            <int>
##  1 Dipodomys        16167
##  2 Chaetodipus       6029
##  3 Onychomys         3267
##  4 Reithrodontomys   2694
##  5 Peromyscus        2234
##  6 Perognathus       1629
##  7 Neotoma           1252
##  8 Ammospermophilus   437
##  9 Amphispiza         303
## 10 Spermophilus       249
## # … with 16 more rows
```

```r
deserts %>% 
  count(species, sort=T)
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 × 2
##    species          n
##    <chr>        <int>
##  1 merriami     10596
##  2 penicillatus  3123
##  3 ordii         3027
##  4 baileyi       2891
##  5 megalotis     2609
##  6 spectabilis   2504
##  7 torridus      2249
##  8 flavus        1597
##  9 eremicus      1299
## 10 albigula      1252
## # … with 30 more rows
```

3. What is the proportion of taxa included in this study? Show a table and plot that reflects this count.
Majority of the taxa in this study is Rodent.

```r
deserts %>% 
  count(taxa, sort=T)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=taxa, y=n))+
  geom_col()
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

4. For the taxa included in the study, use the fill option to show the proportion of individuals sampled by `plot_type.`

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = plot_type, fill = taxa)) + geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Deserts",
       x = "Plot Type",
       fill = "Taxa")
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

5. What is the range of weight for each species included in the study? Remove any observations of weight that are NA so they do not show up in the plot.

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y=species))+geom_boxplot(na.rm=T)+scale_x_log10()
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

6. Add another layer to your answer from #4 using `geom_point` to get an idea of how many measurements were taken for each species.

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y=species))+geom_boxplot(na.rm=T)+geom_point(na.rm=T)+scale_x_log10()
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

7. [Dipodomys merriami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat) is the most frequently sampled animal in the study. How have the number of observations of this species changed over the years included in the study?

```r
deserts%>%
  count(species,year)%>%
  filter(species == "merriami")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=n))+
  geom_col()
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

8. What is the relationship between `weight` and `hindfoot` length? Consider whether or not over plotting is an issue.

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length))+geom_jitter(size=0.1)
```

```
## Warning: Removed 4048 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

9. Which two species have, on average, the highest weight? Once you have identified them, make a new column that is a ratio of `weight` to `hindfoot_length`. Make a plot that shows the range of this new ratio and fill by sex.
Albigula and spectabilis have the highest weight.

```r
deserts %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_weight=mean(weight,na.rm=T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 × 2
##    species      mean_weight
##    <chr>              <dbl>
##  1 albigula           159. 
##  2 spectabilis        120. 
##  3 spilosoma           93.5
##  4 hispidus            65.6
##  5 fulviventer         58.9
##  6 ochrognathus        55.4
##  7 ordii               48.9
##  8 merriami            43.2
##  9 baileyi             31.7
## 10 leucogaster         31.6
## # … with 30 more rows
```



```r
deserts %>%  
  filter(species=="albigula" | species=="spectabilis")%>%
  mutate(ratio=weight/hindfoot_length) %>% 
  filter(ratio!="NA" & sex!="NA")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=species, y=ratio, fill=sex)) + geom_boxplot(na.rm=T)
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

10. Make one plot of your choice! Make sure to include at least two of the aesthetics options you have learned.

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species, fill = plot_type)) + geom_bar(position = position_fill())+ 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), face='bold', hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Observations of Plot Type by Species",
       x = "Species",
       fill = "Plot Type")
```
